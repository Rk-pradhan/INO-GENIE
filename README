                 GENIE-GEANT4 Interface for INO-ICAL
               ----------------------------------------


In this project, GENIE is interfaced with GEANT4 for INO-ICAL geometry. GENIE 
is a neutrino event generator. After generating events in GENIE, you will get a
data file in root format  which contains all final particle's informations (eg.
 pdg, position, energy, momentum, etc). These informations have been given to
 GEANT4. In GEANT4, three new commands have been defined, you can read about
 it in the document GENIE-GEANT4-Interface.pdf. One can shoot particles for a
 particular interaction and scattering type pairs.  


To run this :

	1. Make a build folder : mkdir build
	2. Go to the build folder. : cd build
	3. cmake it : cmake ../INO-GENIE
	4. make it : make -j4
	5. run it : ./ino-genie

To shoot particles :

     To shoot particles for interaction type cc (charged-current) and scattering 
type qes (Quasi-elastic current) from GENIE, 

	 /genie/interaction_type cc
	 /genie/Scattering_type qes
	 /run/beamOn 1

To shoot particle without visualization : 
	1. use genie.mac file.
	2. run it : ./ino-genie genie.mac
